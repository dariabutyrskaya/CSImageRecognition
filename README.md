# Wi-Fi CSI Human Movement Recognition using visualized readings

## Overview

Over the last decade, smart home health monitoring systems have greatly benefited from a diverse range of sensing technologies. While standard technologies like passive infrared sensors (PIRs) for motion detection and magnetic switches for door tracking have been mainstream, their data production remains limited due to their ambient nature. Meanwhile, although cameras and wearables provide richer data, they can be perceived as invasive, limiting their widespread adoption. Addressing this need for a balance between non-invasiveness and data richness, this research explores the utilization of Channel State Information (CSI) derived from common Wi-Fi signals to facilitate human movement recognition in smart homes.

## Key Features

- **Non-Invasive Monitoring**: Harness the power of ambient CSI without resorting to potentially intrusive devices.
- **Data-Rich Recognition**: Utilize vision techniques to classify specific movements, marrying the strengths of both ambient sensors and richer data technologies.
- **Cutting-edge Approach**: Directly correlate recorded frequencies with specific human movements, pioneering a novel approach in health monitoring.

## Contribution

This groundbreaking research:

1. Proposes a fresh perspective on leveraging ubiquitous format of Wi-Fi radio signals for movement recognition.
2. Bridges the gap between the need for rich data and respecting residents' comfort and privacy.
3. Points towards a significant evolution in the CSI Human Movement Recognition field, paving the way for further exploration and potential applications.
